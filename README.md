Hide `!Send` and `!Sync` types inside a [`DiplomaticBag`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_bag) which can be sent between thread freely.

```rust
let one = DiplomaticBag::new(|| Rc::new(RefCell::new(1)));
let two = DiplomaticBag::new(|| Rc::new(RefCell::new(2)));
let three: u8 = std::thread::spawn(|| {
    one.as_ref()
        .zip(two.as_ref())
        .map(|(one, two)| *one.borrow() + *two.borrow())
        .into_inner()
}).join()?;
```
(I don't know why you'd want to do this ^, but I promise this comes in handy for `!Send` types not in std, for example, [cpal's `Stream` type](https://docs.rs/cpal/*/cpal/struct.Stream.html).)


## How it works

All the operations on values inside `DiplomaticBags` are sent to a worker thread (the home country ðŸ˜‰).
This means the values are only ever read on one thread, allowing the `DiplomaticBag` to be `Send` even if the type it contains is not.
This model does have some drawbacks, see [the docs](https://docs.rs/diplomatic-bag/) for more information.
